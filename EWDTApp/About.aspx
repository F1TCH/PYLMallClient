<header><h1><strong>About Us</strong></h1></header>
 
 <p>We are a team of IT students which has been tasked to design and develop an enterprise web application that requires us to make full use of Web 2.0 technologies in useful and innovation scenarios. </p>
 
 <header><h1><strong>What problem are we trying to solve?</strong></h1></header>

 <p>As my team and I were looking for realistic-first world problems, we chanced upon a problem that relates to the latest mall that is currently being built in Paya Lebar. In order to rent a space in the Paya Lebar mall to open a shop, shop owners have to go through a tedious process of having to submit an application form on the mall’s website to inquire about the cost price. In addition to the application form, interested shop owners would also have to go through the process of agents to rent the space. However, my team and I have come up with an alternative solution to shorten all these processes to get the rented shop they want. </p>

 <header><h1><strong>What is our proposed solution to the problem?</strong></h1></header>

 <p>The proposed alternative solution to the problem is simply a web application that allows interested shop owners to purchase rental of space in a mall to set-up their shops through a bidding platform. </p>
 <p>The shop owners are represented as users who will start off by creating an account in the application. After their account has been created, they will then be redirected to the homepage. The users will then have to select the view units in the homepage, after which they will be given a selection of choices from the different levels in the mall. Beside it will be a drop down list, listing out all the units of that particular level. For example; when the third floor in the mall is selected by the user, the floor plan of the third level will loaded, followed by all the units in that particular level. </p>
 <p>To add on, the users will be given a choice to bid for the rental of their preferred unit below. When the user decides to place bidding for the unit and submits, the system will begin to show the minimum bid for the unit before redirecting the user to a web page to fill in their particulars, and be notified of the terms and condition. </p>
 <p>When the user has placed their bidding, they will have a choice of returning to the bidding page to view their current bid, update their biddings or to even viewing the minimum bid once again. However, users will have to take note that they will be limited to a maximum of updating their bid thrice only. </p>
 <p>When a user has won the bidding for the particular unit, a generated email notification by the application will be sent out to the users email notifying them that they have won, the amount payable for the unit according to their bid and the meeting details with a contactable number belonging to the malls company for users who have any inquires attached to it. </p>
